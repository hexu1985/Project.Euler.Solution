### Problem 2

**Even Fibonacci numbers**

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:

$$
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \cdots
$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**偶斐波那契数**

斐波那契数列中的每一项都是前两项的和。由$1$和$2$开始生成的斐波那契数列的前$10$项为：

$$
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \cdots
$$

考虑该斐波那契数列中不超过四百万的项，求其中为偶数的项之和。

answer code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

upper_limit = 4000000

fn_2 = 0
fn_1 = 1
fn = fn_1 + fn_2

ans = 0
while True:
    if fn >= upper_limit:
        break
    if fn % 2 == 0:
        ans += fn
    fn_2 = fn_1
    fn_1 = fn
    fn = fn_1 + fn_2

print("ans:", ans)
```
